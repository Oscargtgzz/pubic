- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of trust and reliability, aligning with fleet management's critical nature.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F0F2F5), almost white, to reduce distraction. Indigo's analogous colors help create a subtle background.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688), slightly brighter, to add vibrancy to highlights. Being an analogous color this fits nicely with the Indigo to allow vibrancy for various different aspects.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts (like Open Sans or Roboto) for readability and a modern look.

- A grid-based layout that ensures that information is easy to access and understand in order.
- Subtle transitions and animations to acknowledge user interactions without being distracting.
